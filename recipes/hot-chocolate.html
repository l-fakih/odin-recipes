    <p>I love hot chocolate.  Given the opportunity, I will drink very great quantities of the stuff.  This afternoon, as I was about to head out on my run of errands, I felt in need of a pick-me-up.  I had exactly seven minutes before I had to leave, so I decided to make my quick and easy hot chocolate recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup half-and-half cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a saucepan; add boiling water and whisk until smooth. Bring mixture to a simmer, stirring continuously to prevent scorching, and cook for 2 minutes.</li>
