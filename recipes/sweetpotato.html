    <p>These are the best air fryer sweet potato fries! They are so crispy, flavorful and easy to make in the air fryer. Here I share two methods, a quick method that is delicious and a longer method that comes out perfectly crisp. Both taste great, feel free to use the method you prefer! Since you only need a little oil, they are also lighter and healthier than deep frying. One of my first recipes I ever made with my air fryer.</p>
